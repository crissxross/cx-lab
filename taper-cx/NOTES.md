# My taper dev notes

## TECH NOTES

### head meta
This meta tag for mobile devices is NOT included in the template's head
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

### font-size
I don't know if it's worth doing responsive scale font-size because template doesn't have meta tag for mobile
`font-size: clamp(1.13rem, calc(1.08rem + 0.22vw), 1.25rem);`
