# Taper 11 - crissxross

## Submissions for Issue #11

All are welcome to submit for possible publication in future issues, but please see the information about our reading periods and the specific calls for each issue. We plan for the information about each N+1<sup>th</sup> issue to be included with the release of the N<sup>th</sup> issue.

_Taper_ #11 invites submissions in response to the theme _“Parallels”_. The number 11, especially when rendered in many sans-serif fonts, presents itself as two parallel lines, evoking a pair of chopsticks, a hallway in an ASCII game, symmetry, palindromes, and e. e. cummings’s poem “\[l(a\],” which explores the visual ambiguity of the letter l and the number 1. We encourage explorations of parallelism: not meeting, maintaining distance, parallelism in programming and processing, parallel universes and lives, twins, parallelograms, and so on. _Taper_ exists in the space between programming and poetry, two areas that seemingly have parallel trajectories with minimal crossover, except in the world of digital poetry. We are also, as always, interested in allusions to the number 11, including the 11-year sunspot cycle, the character Eleven in _Stranger Things_, the volume dial in _This is Spinal Tap_, mystical references to the number as lucky, the number of players in games like soccer, football, cricket, and bandy, and even near-spellings of the word, as with Tolkien’s beloved Elven people.

#### Submission Details

-   [Download our template in a zip file](https://taper.badquar.to/10/about.htmltemplate.zip) so that you can edit it. After you have it and have unzipped it, edit only two parts of the file: the long comment at the top, which will hold your title, your name, and a creative statement from you, and the very end of the file, where your tiny computational poem is to be placed.
-   All code (in the form of ES6, CSS, and HTML) must be placed between the template’s closing header tag (</header>) and the closing body tag (</body>), must be valid HTML5, and must fit within 2KB (2048 bytes).
-   Use the [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to validate the page after you finish.
-   Submissions should not use any external libraries or APIs, nor link to any external resources, including fonts. This is so that pages will be self-contained following _Taper_’s vision. It also has the practical purpose of allowing all of _Taper_’s work to be viewed without a network connection, for instance, in a gallery setting.
-   Please refer to this About page for [license](https://taper.badquar.to/10/about.html#license) terms under which all poems have been and will be released; by submitting to _Taper_ #10, you agree that, if we accept your work, we may release it, copyright by you, under this same short all-permissive license. Since you are submitting the work to us in the provided template, this will be part of your submission.

#### Timeline

Submissions for this issue will be accepted until **Sept. 17, 2023** at **11:59 PM AoE**. _Taper_ #11 will be published in Fall 2023. There will be no deadline extensions.

We invite submissions until then from those interested in participating at **parallels@badquar.to**. Simply attach your work in one zip file containing your HTML files (up to five per author will be considered). You should then receive an email acknowledging our receipt of your work within a few days.

## My notes

### Size

Max poem code size: *2KB (2048 bytes)*

The size of the template before any poem code is added is *1.31 KiB*

The size of basic `<html><body></body></html>` alone is *35 bytes*

So if I develop my poem code inside a basic `<html><body> </body></html>` it needs to be 2048 + 35 bytes = *2083 bytes MAX*
