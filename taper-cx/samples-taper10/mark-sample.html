Struggling to deal with the sudden passing of my father, I turned to
old nursery rhymes from my childhood. It’s not as strange as it
sounds. So many nursery rhymes deal with death. In particular, “One
for Sorrow“ and “Solomon Grundy” are both about the cycle of life,
which inevitably includes death. Both nursery rhymes walk through the
chrononormative markers of aging: birth, childhood, love, aging, and
dying. And both nursery rhymes, in their most popular forms, happen
to have 10 lines each. “One for Grundy” remixes these two 10-line
nursery rhymes into a single 10-line poem. In many ways, the process
resembles the playful approach to reading that Jerry McGann and Lisa
Samuels call “deformance.” A deformance deliberately reads a work in
the wrong way, for example, reading a poem backwards line-by-line.
Reading backwards revitalizes a text, revealing its constructedness,
its seams, edges, and working parts. But how much revitalization is
happening in “One for Grundy”? In the case of these two nursery
rhymes, the so-called “proper” sequence of life and death becomes
scrambled. The jumbled, chaotic feeling mirrors the experience of an
utterly unexpected death of a loved one. Suddenly, the rhyme of their
life is out of order. The story doesn’t make sense anymore.
