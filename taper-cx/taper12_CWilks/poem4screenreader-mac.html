MAC VERSION

In general, a11y accessibility principles tend to be at odds with the goals of computational poetry and brevity. So, somewhat perversely, I decided to create a poem for assistive technology. I was curious to see if I could make an accessible computational poem specifically for the built-in screen readers for Mac and Windows: VoiceOver and Narrator respectively. I didn't realise how tricky it would be! For one thing, the screen readers have different operations, hence there are two versions of the poem.

It turns out that I needed to dedicate a substantial chunk of the 2KB limit for user instructions. I could've put all the instructions here, in this statement, but that would have defeated the purpose. Testing the screen reader (for Mac) and writing the instructions was time-consuming and frequently frustrating. It gave me a small insight into what web browsing might be like for people who depend on screen readers. I spent way more time testing (&/or reading screen reader guides) than coding.

The poem has 12 lines. The final line is not in the code, it's delivered by VoiceOver or Narrator (at least, I hope Narrator behaves the same way).

Please note: I use a Mac and don't have access to Windows OS so I haven't been able to test on that platform. If the onscreen instructions for Windows are inaccurate or lacking in any way, please let me know and I'll try to improve them (bearing in mind that I need to keep them succinct).

FURTHER HELP - LINKS TO USER GUIDES

The guides refer to either a VoiceOver (VO) modifier key or Narrator key - the Caps Lock key is one of the defaults on both platforms. I've used this default key in my instructions.
