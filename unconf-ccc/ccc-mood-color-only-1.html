<!-- NOTES (comments):

All the JavaScript (JS) code is inside the <script> tags (below). Comments are lines of text in the code that are ignored by the browser. Here they're used to help explain the code. In JavaScript, comments start with //

Meaning of symbols used in the code:

  let - keyword to declare a variable (note: there are others but this code uses let throughout for simplicity)

  Assignment operator: =
    The assignment operator is used to assign a value to a variable. For example, let x = 5; assigns the value 5 to the variable x.

  Greater than: >
  Greater than or equal to: >=
  Less than: <
  Less than or equal to: <=
  Strictly equal to: ===
  Strictly not equal to: !==

  ` ` - syntax for template strings (text), used for multi-line strings and string interpolation (inserting a variable into a string)

  ${ } - syntax to insert a variable (or expression) into a string

COLOR
  There are a number of ways to specify colors in CSS & JavaScript. This code uses the HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) color model:
    - Hue: the color type (0-360 degrees on the color wheel)
    - Saturation: the intensity of the color (0-100%)
    - Lightness: the brightness of the color (0-100%)
  For example:
    - hsl(0 100% 40%) is a shade of red
    - hsl(120 100% 40%) is a shade of green
    - hsl(240 100% 40%) is a shade of blue
  (note: you can also use this syntax, e.g. hsl(0 100 40) )
